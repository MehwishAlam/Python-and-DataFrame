# Python-and-DataFrame
This repository contains Python code examples for basic commands, list operations, and DataFrame manipulation using pandas. It includes demonstrations of adding, deleting, and inserting data in DataFrames.

Code Overview:

1. Variable Assignment and Printing:
   The notebook starts by initializing several variables: name, age, height, and is_student.
   It then prints the values of these variables to the console.

2. Checking Variable Types:
   This section checks the data types of the variables initialized in the previous section.

3. Importing Pandas:
   The Pandas library is imported to facilitate data manipulation tasks later in the notebook.
   This cell does not produce any immediate output, but it sets up the environment for working with data frames in subsequent cells.

Additional Sections:
   The notebook may contain further sections that involve creating and manipulating data frames, performing data analysis, and visualizing results. These sections would build on the foundational concepts introduced in the earlier cells.
